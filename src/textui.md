The Command-Line Test Runner {#textui}
============================

The PHPUnit command-line test runner can be invoked through the
`phpunit` command. The following code shows how to run tests with the
PHPUnit command-line test runner:

    phpunit ArrayTest
    PHPUnit 5.3.0 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.

    ..

    Time: 0 seconds


    OK (2 tests, 2 assertions)

When invoked as shown above, the PHPUnit command-line test runner will
look for a `ArrayTest.php` sourcefile in the current working directory,
load it, and expect to find a `ArrayTest` test case class. It will then
execute the tests of that class.

For each test run, the PHPUnit command-line tool prints one character to
indicate progress:

`.`

:   Printed when the test succeeds.

`F`

:   Printed when an assertion fails while running the test method.

`E`

:   Printed when an error occurs while running the test method.

`R`

:   Printed when the test has been marked as risky (see ?).

`S`

:   Printed when the test has been skipped (see ?).

`I`

:   Printed when the test is marked as being incomplete or not yet
    implemented (see ?).

Error Failure PHPUnit distinguishes between *failures* and *errors*. A
failure is a violated PHPUnit assertion such as a failing
`assertEquals()` call. An error is an unexpected exception or a PHP
error. Sometimes this distinction proves useful since errors tend to be
easier to fix than failures. If you have a big list of problems, it is
best to tackle the errors first and see if you have any failures left
when they are all fixed.

`phpunit UnitTest`

:   Runs the tests that are provided by the class `UnitTest`. This class
    is expected to be declared in the `UnitTest.php` sourcefile.

    `UnitTest` must be either a class that inherits from
    `PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase` or a class that provides a
    `public static suite()` method which returns a
    `PHPUnit_Framework_Test` object, for example an instance of the
    `PHPUnit_Framework_TestSuite` class.

`phpunit UnitTest UnitTest.php`

:   Runs the tests that are provided by the class `UnitTest`. This class
    is expected to be declared in the specified sourcefile.

`--coverage-clover`

:   Generates a logfile in XML format with the code coverage information
    for the tests run. See ? for more details.

    Please note that this functionality is only available when the
    tokenizer and Xdebug extensions are installed.

`--coverage-crap4j`

:   Generates a code coverage report in Crap4j format. See ? for more
    details.

    Please note that this functionality is only available when the
    tokenizer and Xdebug extensions are installed.

`--coverage-html`

:   Generates a code coverage report in HTML format. See ? for more
    details.

    Please note that this functionality is only available when the
    tokenizer and Xdebug extensions are installed.

`--coverage-php`

:   Generates a serialized PHP\_CodeCoverage object with the code
    coverage information.

    Please note that this functionality is only available when the
    tokenizer and Xdebug extensions are installed.

`--coverage-text`

:   Generates a logfile or command-line output in human readable format
    with the code coverage information for the tests run. See ? for more
    details.

    Please note that this functionality is only available when the
    tokenizer and Xdebug extensions are installed.

`--log-junit`

:   Generates a logfile in JUnit XML format for the tests run. See ? for
    more details.

`--log-tap`

:   Generates a logfile using the [Test Anything Protocol
    (TAP)](http://testanything.org/) format for the tests run. See ? for
    more details.

`--log-json`

:   Generates a logfile using the [JSON](http://www.json.org/) format.
    See ? for more details.

`--testdox-html` and `--testdox-text`

:   Generates agile documentation in HTML or plain text format for the
    tests that are run. See ? for more details.

`--filter`

:   Only runs tests whose name matches the given regular expression
    pattern. If the pattern is not enclosed in delimiters, PHPUnit will
    enclose the pattern in `/` delimiters.

    The test names to match will be in one of the following formats:

    `TestNamespace\TestCaseClass::testMethod`

    :   The default test name format is the equivalent of using the
        `__METHOD__` magic constant inside the test method.

    `TestNamespace\TestCaseClass::testMethod with data set #0`

    :   When a test has a data provider, each iteration of the data gets
        the current index appended to the end of the default test name.

    `TestNamespace\TestCaseClass::testMethod with data set "my named data"`

    :   When a test has a data provider that uses named sets, each
        iteration of the data gets the current name appended to the end
        of the default test name. See ? for an example of named data
        sets.

            <?php
            namespace TestNamespace;

            class TestCaseClass extends \PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
            {
                /**
                 * @dataProvider provider
                 */
                public function testMethod($data)
                {
                    $this->assertTrue($data);
                }

                public function provider()
                {
                    return array(
                       'my named data' => array(true),
                       'my data'       => array(true)
                    );
                }
            }
            ?>

    `/path/to/my/test.phpt`

    :   The test name for a PHPT test is the filesystem path.

    See ? for examples of valid filter patterns.

    -   `--filter 'TestNamespace\\TestCaseClass::testMethod'`

    -   `--filter 'TestNamespace\\TestCaseClass'`

    -   `--filter TestNamespace`

    -   `--filter TestCaseClass`

    -   `--filter testMethod`

    -   `--filter '/::testMethod .*"my named data"/'`

    -   `--filter '/::testMethod .*#5$/'`

    -   `--filter '/::testMethod .*#(5|6|7)$/'`

    See ? for some additional shortcuts that are available for matching
    data providers.

    -   `--filter 'testMethod#2'`

    -   `--filter 'testMethod#2-4'`

    -   `--filter '#2'`

    -   `--filter '#2-4'`

    -   `--filter 'testMethod@my named data'`

    -   `--filter 'testMethod@my.*data'`

    -   `--filter '@my named data'`

    -   `--filter '@my.*data'`

`--testsuite`

:   Only runs the test suite whose name matches the given pattern.

`--group`

:   Only runs tests from the specified group(s). A test can be tagged as
    belonging to a group using the `@group` annotation.

    The `@author` annotation is an alias for `@group` allowing to filter
    tests based on their authors.

`--exclude-group`

:   Exclude tests from the specified group(s). A test can be tagged as
    belonging to a group using the `@group` annotation.

`--list-groups`

:   List available test groups.

`--test-suffix`

:   Only search for test files with specified suffix(es).

`--report-useless-tests`

:   Be strict about tests that do not test anything. See ? for details.

`--strict-coverage`

:   Be strict about unintentionally covered code. See ? for details.

`--strict-global-state`

:   Be strict about global state manipulation. See ? for details.

`--disallow-test-output`

:   Be strict about output during tests. See ? for details.

`--disallow-todo-tests`

:   Does not execute tests which have the `@todo` annotation in its
    docblock.

`--enforce-time-limit`

:   Enforce time limit based on test size. See ? for details.

`--process-isolation`

:   Run each test in a separate PHP process.

`--no-globals-backup`

:   Do not backup and restore \$GLOBALS. See ? for more details.

`--static-backup`

:   Backup and restore static attributes of user-defined classes. See ?
    for more details.

`--colors`

:   Use colors in output. On Windows, use
    [ANSICON](https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon) or
    [ConEmu](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu).

    There are three possible values for this option:

    -   `never`: never displays colors in the output. This is the
        default value when `--colors` option is not used.

    -   `auto`: displays colors in the output unless the current
        terminal doesn't supports colors, or if the output is piped to a
        command or redirected to a file.

    -   `always`: always displays colors in the output even when the
        current terminal doesn't supports colors, or when the output is
        piped to a command or redirected to a file.

    When `--colors` is used without any value, `auto` is the chosen
    value.

`--columns`

:   Defines the number of columns to use for progress output. If `max`
    is defined as value, the number of columns will be maximum of the
    current terminal.

`--stderr`

:   Optionally print to `STDERR` instead of `STDOUT`.

`--stop-on-error`

:   Stop execution upon first error.

`--stop-on-failure`

:   Stop execution upon first error or failure.

`--stop-on-risky`

:   Stop execution upon first risky test.

`--stop-on-skipped`

:   Stop execution upon first skipped test.

`--stop-on-incomplete`

:   Stop execution upon first incomplete test.

`--verbose`

:   Output more verbose information, for instance the names of tests
    that were incomplete or have been skipped.

`--debug`

:   Output debug information such as the name of a test when its
    execution starts.

`--loader`

:   Specifies the `PHPUnit_Runner_TestSuiteLoader` implementation to
    use.

    The standard test suite loader will look for the sourcefile in the
    current working directory and in each directory that is specified in
    PHP's `include_path` configuration directive. A class name such as
    `Project_Package_Class` is mapped to the source filename
    `Project/Package/Class.php`.

`--repeat`

:   Repeatedly runs the test(s) the specified number of times.

`--tap`

:   Reports the test progress using the [Test Anything Protocol
    (TAP)](http://testanything.org/). See ? for more details.

`--testdox`

:   Reports the test progress as agile documentation. See ? for more
    details.

`--printer`

:   Specifies the result printer to use. The printer class must extend
    `PHPUnit_Util_Printer` and implement the
    `PHPUnit_Framework_TestListener` interface.

`--bootstrap`

:   A "bootstrap" PHP file that is run before the tests.

`--configuration`; `-c`

:   Read configuration from XML file. See ? for more details.

    If `phpunit.xml` or `phpunit.xml.dist` (in that order) exist in the
    current working directory and `--configuration` is *not* used, the
    configuration will be automatically read from that file.

`--no-configuration`

:   Ignore `phpunit.xml` and `phpunit.xml.dist` from the current working
    directory.

`--include-path`

:   Prepend PHP's `include_path` with given path(s).

`-d`

:   Sets the value of the given PHP configuration option.
