Fixtures
========

Fixture One of the most time-consuming parts of writing tests is writing
the code to set the world up in a known state and then return it to its
original state when the test is complete. This known state is called the
*fixture* of the test.

In ?, the fixture was simply the array that is stored in the `$stack`
variable. Most of the time, though, the fixture will be more complex
than a simple array, and the amount of code needed to set it up will
grow accordingly. The actual content of the test gets lost in the noise
of setting up the fixture. This problem gets even worse when you write
several tests with similar fixtures. Without some help from the testing
framework, we would have to duplicate the code that sets up the fixture
for each test we write.

Template Method setUp() tearDown() PHPUnit supports sharing the setup
code. Before a test method is run, a template method called `setUp()` is
invoked. `setUp()` is where you create the objects against which you
will test. Once the test method has finished running, whether it
succeeded or failed, another template method called `tearDown()` is
invoked. `tearDown()` is where you clean up the objects against which
you tested.

In ? we used the producer-consumer relationship between tests to share a
fixture. This is not always desired or even possible. ? shows how we can
write the tests of the `StackTest` in such a way that not the fixture
itself is reused but the code that creates it. First we declare the
instance variable, `$stack`, that we are going to use instead of a
method-local variable. Then we put the creation of the `array` fixture
into the `setUp()` method. Finally, we remove the redundant code from
the test methods and use the newly introduced instance variable,
`$this->stack`, instead of the method-local variable `$stack` with the
`assertEquals()` assertion method.

    <?php
    class StackTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
    {
        protected $stack;

        protected function setUp()
        {
            $this->stack = array();
        }

        public function testEmpty()
        {
            $this->assertTrue(empty($this->stack));
        }

        public function testPush()
        {
            array_push($this->stack, 'foo');
            $this->assertEquals('foo', $this->stack[count($this->stack)-1]);
            $this->assertFalse(empty($this->stack));
        }

        public function testPop()
        {
            array_push($this->stack, 'foo');
            $this->assertEquals('foo', array_pop($this->stack));
            $this->assertTrue(empty($this->stack));
        }
    }
    ?>

Template Method setUpBeforeClass() setUp() tearDown()
tearDownAfterClass() The `setUp()` and `tearDown()` template methods are
run once for each test method (and on fresh instances) of the test case
class.

Template Method setUpBeforeClass() setUp() assertPreConditions()
assertPostConditions() tearDown() tearDownAfterClass()
onNotSuccessfulTest() In addition, the `setUpBeforeClass()` and
`tearDownAfterClass()` template methods are called before the first test
of the test case class is run and after the last test of the test case
class is run, respectively.

Template Method The example below shows all template methods that are
available in a test case class.

    <?php
    class TemplateMethodsTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
    {
        public static function setUpBeforeClass()
        {
            fwrite(STDOUT, __METHOD__ . "\n");
        }

        protected function setUp()
        {
            fwrite(STDOUT, __METHOD__ . "\n");
        }

        protected function assertPreConditions()
        {
            fwrite(STDOUT, __METHOD__ . "\n");
        }

        public function testOne()
        {
            fwrite(STDOUT, __METHOD__ . "\n");
            $this->assertTrue(TRUE);
        }

        public function testTwo()
        {
            fwrite(STDOUT, __METHOD__ . "\n");
            $this->assertTrue(FALSE);
        }

        protected function assertPostConditions()
        {
            fwrite(STDOUT, __METHOD__ . "\n");
        }

        protected function tearDown()
        {
            fwrite(STDOUT, __METHOD__ . "\n");
        }

        public static function tearDownAfterClass()
        {
            fwrite(STDOUT, __METHOD__ . "\n");
        }

        protected function onNotSuccessfulTest(Exception $e)
        {
            fwrite(STDOUT, __METHOD__ . "\n");
            throw $e;
        }
    }
    ?>

More setUp() than tearDown() {#fixtures.more-setup-than-teardown}
============================

`setUp()` and `tearDown()` are nicely symmetrical in theory but not in
practice. In practice, you only need to implement `tearDown()` if you
have allocated external resources like files or sockets in `setUp()`. If
your `setUp()` just creates plain PHP objects, you can generally ignore
`tearDown()`. However, if you create many objects in your `setUp()`, you
might want to `unset()` the variables pointing to those objects in your
`tearDown()` so they can be garbage collected. The garbage collection of
test case objects is not predictable.

Variations {#fixtures.variations}
==========

What happens when you have two tests with slightly different setups?
There are two possibilities:

-   If the `setUp()` code differs only slightly, move the code that
    differs from the `setUp()` code to the test method.

-   If you really have a different `setUp()`, you need a different test
    case class. Name the class after the difference in the setup.

Sharing Fixture {#fixtures.sharing-fixture}
===============

There are few good reasons to share fixtures between tests, but in most
cases the need to share a fixture between tests stems from an unresolved
design problem.

A good example of a fixture that makes sense to share across several
tests is a database connection: you log into the database once and reuse
the database connection instead of creating a new connection for each
test. This makes your tests run faster.

setUpBeforeClass tearDownAfterClass ? uses the `setUpBeforeClass()` and
`tearDownAfterClass()` template methods to connect to the database
before the test case class' first test and to disconnect from the
database after the last test of the test case, respectively.

    <?php
    class DatabaseTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
    {
        protected static $dbh;

        public static function setUpBeforeClass()
        {
            self::$dbh = new PDO('sqlite::memory:');
        }

        public static function tearDownAfterClass()
        {
            self::$dbh = NULL;
        }
    }
    ?>

It cannot be emphasized enough that sharing fixtures between tests
reduces the value of the tests. The underlying design problem is that
objects are not loosely coupled. You will achieve better results solving
the underlying design problem and then writing tests using stubs (see
?), than by creating dependencies between tests at runtime and ignoring
the opportunity to improve your design.

Global State {#fixtures.global-state}
============

[It is hard to test code that uses
singletons.](http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2008/05/tott-using-dependancy-injection-to.html)
The same is true for code that uses global variables. Typically, the
code you want to test is coupled strongly with a global variable and you
cannot control its creation. An additional problem is the fact that one
test's change to a global variable might break another test.

In PHP, global variables work like this:

-   A global variable `$foo = 'bar';` is stored as
    `$GLOBALS['foo'] = 'bar';`.

-   The `$GLOBALS` variable is a so-called *super-global* variable.

-   Super-global variables are built-in variables that are always
    available in all scopes.

-   In the scope of a function or method, you may access the global
    variable `$foo` by either directly accessing `$GLOBALS['foo']` or by
    using `global $foo;` to create a local variable with a reference to
    the global variable.

Besides global variables, static attributes of classes are also part of
the global state.

Global Variable Test Isolation By default, PHPUnit runs your tests in a
way where changes to global and super-global variables (`$GLOBALS`,
`$_ENV`, `$_POST`, `$_GET`, `$_COOKIE`, `$_SERVER`, `$_FILES`,
`$_REQUEST`) do not affect other tests. Optionally, this isolation can
be extended to static attributes of classes.

> **Note**
>
> The backup and restore operations for global variables and static
> class attributes use `serialize()` and `unserialize()`.
>
> Objects of some classes (e.g., `PDO`) cannot be serialized and the
> backup operation will break when such an object is stored e.g. in the
> `$GLOBALS` array.

`@backupGlobals` `$backupGlobalsBlacklist` The `@backupGlobals`
annotation that is discussed in ? can be used to control the backup and
restore operations for global variables. Alternatively, you can provide
a blacklist of global variables that are to be excluded from the backup
and restore operations like this

    class MyTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
    {
        protected $backupGlobalsBlacklist = array('globalVariable');

        // ...
    }

> **Note**
>
> Setting the `$backupGlobalsBlacklist` property inside e.g. the
> `setUp()` method has no effect.

`@backupStaticAttributes` `$backupStaticAttributesBlacklist` The
`@backupStaticAttributes` annotation discussed in ? can be used to back
up all static property values in all declared classes before each test
and restore them afterwards.

It processes all classes that are declared at the time a test starts,
not only the test class itself. It only applies to static class
properties, not static variables within functions.

> **Note**
>
> The `@backupStaticAttributes` operation is executed before a test
> method, but only if it is enabled. If a static value was changed by a
> previously executed test that did not have `@backupStaticAttributes`
> enabled, then that value will be backed up and restored — not the
> originally declared default value. PHP does not record the originally
> declared default value of any static variable.
>
> The same applies to static properties of classes that were newly
> loaded/declared within a test. They cannot be reset to their
> originally declared default value after the test, since that value is
> unknown. Whichever value is set will leak into subsequent tests.
>
> For unit tests, it is recommended to explicitly reset the values of
> static properties under test in your `setUp()` code instead (and
> ideally also `tearDown()`, so as to not affect subsequently executed
> tests).

You can provide a blacklist of static attributes that are to be excluded
from the backup and restore operations:

    class MyTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
    {
        protected $backupStaticAttributesBlacklist = array(
          'className' => array('attributeName')
        );

        // ...
    }

> **Note**
>
> Setting the `$backupStaticAttributesBlacklist` property inside e.g.
> the `setUp()` method has no effect.
