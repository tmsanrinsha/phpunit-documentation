Code Coverage Analysis
======================

> In computer science, code coverage is a measure used to describe the
> degree to which the source code of a program is tested by a particular
> test suite. A program with high code coverage has been more thoroughly
> tested and has a lower chance of containing software bugs than a
> program with low code coverage.

Code Coverage Xdebug In this chapter you will learn all about PHPUnit's
code coverage functionality that provides an insight into what parts of
the production code are executed when the tests are run. It makes use of
the
[PHP\_CodeCoverage](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/php-code-coverage)
component, which in turn leverages the code coverage functionality
provided by the [Xdebug](http://xdebug.org/) extension for PHP.

> **Note**
>
> Xdebug is not distributed as part of PHPUnit. If you receive a notice
> while running tests that the Xdebug extension is not loaded, it means
> that Xdebug is either not installed or not configured properly. Before
> you can use the code coverage analysis features in PHPUnit, you should
> read [the Xdebug installation guide](http://xdebug.org/docs/install).

PHPUnit can generate an HTML-based code coverage report as well as
XML-based logfiles with code coverage information in various formats
(Clover, Crap4J, PHPUnit). Code coverage information can also be
reported as text (and printed to STDOUT) and exported as PHP code for
further processing.

Please refer to ? for a list of commandline switches that control code
coverage functionality as well as ? for the relevant configuration
settings.

Software Metrics for Code Coverage {#code-coverage-analysis.metrics}
==================================

Various software metrics exist to measure code coverage:

*Line Coverage*

:   The *Line Coverage* software metric measures whether each executable
    line was executed.

*Function and Method Coverage*

:   The *Function and Method Coverage* software metric measures whether
    each function or method has been invoked. PHP\_CodeCoverage only
    considers a function or method as covered when all of its executable
    lines are covered.

*Class and Trait Coverage*

:   The *Class and Trait Coverage* software metric measures whether each
    method of a class or trait is covered. PHP\_CodeCoverage only
    considers a class or trait as covered when all of its methods are
    covered.

*Opcode Coverage*

:   The *Opcode Coverage* software metric measures whether each opcode
    of a function or method has been executed while running the test
    suite. A line of code usually compiles into more than one opcode.
    Line Coverage regards a line of code as covered as soon as one of
    its opcodes is executed.

*Branch Coverage*

:   The *Branch Coverage* software metric measures whether the boolean
    expression of each control structure evaluated to both `true` and
    `false` while running the test suite.

*Path Coverage*

:   The *Path Coverage* software metric measures whether each of the
    possible execution paths in a function or method has been followed
    while running the test suite. An execution path is a unique sequence
    of branches from the entry of the function or method to its exit.

*Change Risk Anti-Patterns (CRAP) Index*

:   The *Change Risk Anti-Patterns (CRAP) Index* is calculated based on
    the cyclomatic complexity and code coverage of a unit of code. Code
    that is not too complex and has an adequate test coverage will have
    a low CRAP index. The CRAP index can be lowered by writing tests and
    by refactoring the code to lower its complexity.

> **Note**
>
> The *Opcode Coverage*, *Branch Coverage*, and *Path Coverage* software
> metrics are not yet supported by PHP\_CodeCoverage.

Whitelisting Files {#code-coverage-analysis.whitelisting-files}
==================

Code CoverageWhitelist It is mandatory to configure a *whitelist* for
telling PHPUnit which sourcecode files to include in the code coverage
report. This can either be done using the `--whitelist` commandline
option or via the configuration file (see ?).

Optionally, all whitelisted files can be added to the code coverage
report by setting `addUncoveredFilesFromWhitelist="true"` in your
PHPUnit configuration (see ?). This allows the inclusion of files that
are not tested yet at all. If you want to get information about which
lines of such an uncovered file are executable, for instance, you also
need to set `processUncoveredFilesFromWhitelist="true"` in your PHPUnit
configuration (see ?).

> **Note**
>
> Please note that the loading of sourcecode files that is performed
> when `processUncoveredFilesFromWhitelist="true"` is set can cause
> problems when a sourcecode file contains code outside the scope of a
> class or function, for instance.

Ignoring Code Blocks {#code-coverage-analysis.ignoring-code-blocks}
====================

Annotation @codeCoverageIgnore @codeCoverageIgnoreStart
@codeCoverageIgnoreEnd Sometimes you have blocks of code that you cannot
test and that you may want to ignore during code coverage analysis.
PHPUnit lets you do this using the `@codeCoverageIgnore`,
`@codeCoverageIgnoreStart` and `@codeCoverageIgnoreEnd` annotations as
shown in ?.

    <?php
    /**
     * @codeCoverageIgnore
     */
    class Foo
    {
        public function bar()
        {
        }
    }

    class Bar
    {
        /**
         * @codeCoverageIgnore
         */
        public function foo()
        {
        }
    }

    if (FALSE) {
        // @codeCoverageIgnoreStart
        print '*';
        // @codeCoverageIgnoreEnd
    }

    exit; // @codeCoverageIgnore
    ?>

The ignored lines of code (marked as ignored using the annotations) are
counted as executed (if they are executable) and will not be
highlighted.

Specifying Covered Methods {#code-coverage-analysis.specifying-covered-methods}
==========================

Annotation @covers The `@covers` annotation (see ?) can be used in the
test code to specify which method(s) a test method wants to test. If
provided, only the code coverage information for the specified method(s)
will be considered. ? shows an example.

    <?php
    class BankAccountTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
    {
        protected $ba;

        protected function setUp()
        {
            $this->ba = new BankAccount;
        }

        /**
         * @covers BankAccount::getBalance
         */
        public function testBalanceIsInitiallyZero()
        {
            $this->assertEquals(0, $this->ba->getBalance());
        }

        /**
         * @covers BankAccount::withdrawMoney
         */
        public function testBalanceCannotBecomeNegative()
        {
            try {
                $this->ba->withdrawMoney(1);
            }

            catch (BankAccountException $e) {
                $this->assertEquals(0, $this->ba->getBalance());

                return;
            }

            $this->fail();
        }

        /**
         * @covers BankAccount::depositMoney
         */
        public function testBalanceCannotBecomeNegative2()
        {
            try {
                $this->ba->depositMoney(-1);
            }

            catch (BankAccountException $e) {
                $this->assertEquals(0, $this->ba->getBalance());

                return;
            }

            $this->fail();
        }

        /**
         * @covers BankAccount::getBalance
         * @covers BankAccount::depositMoney
         * @covers BankAccount::withdrawMoney
         */
        public function testDepositWithdrawMoney()
        {
            $this->assertEquals(0, $this->ba->getBalance());
            $this->ba->depositMoney(1);
            $this->assertEquals(1, $this->ba->getBalance());
            $this->ba->withdrawMoney(1);
            $this->assertEquals(0, $this->ba->getBalance());
        }
    }
    ?>

Annotation @coversNothing It is also possible to specify that a test
should not cover *any* method by using the `@coversNothing` annotation
(see ?). This can be helpful when writing integration tests to make sure
you only generate code coverage with unit tests.

    <?php
    class GuestbookIntegrationTest extends PHPUnit_Extensions_Database_TestCase
    {
        /**
         * @coversNothing
         */
        public function testAddEntry()
        {
            $guestbook = new Guestbook();
            $guestbook->addEntry("suzy", "Hello world!");

            $queryTable = $this->getConnection()->createQueryTable(
                'guestbook', 'SELECT * FROM guestbook'
            );

            $expectedTable = $this->createFlatXmlDataSet("expectedBook.xml")
                                  ->getTable("guestbook");

            $this->assertTablesEqual($expectedTable, $queryTable);
        }
    }
    ?>
          

Edge Cases {#code-coverage-analysis.edge-cases}
==========

This section shows noteworthy edge cases that lead to confusing code
coverage information.

    <?php
    // Because it is "line based" and not statement base coverage
    // one line will always have one coverage status
    if (false) this_function_call_shows_up_as_covered();

    // Due to how code coverage works internally these two lines are special.
    // This line will show up as non executable
    if (false)
        // This line will show up as covered because it is actually the 
        // coverage of the if statement in the line above that gets shown here!
        will_also_show_up_as_covered();

    // To avoid this it is necessary that braces are used
    if (false) {
        this_call_will_never_show_up_as_covered();
    }
    ?>
